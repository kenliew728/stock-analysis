# Using Refactored VBA Code to Analyze Stocks
---
## **Overview of Project**
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to refactor an existing VBA code in order to make the code more efficient by increasing its execution time
### Current State
The original VBA code was written to analyze 12 stock performances for the year 2017 and 2018. Both analyses took an average of 3.2 seconds to execute. This comes to an average of 0.26 seconds per stock per year. There are currently 2,600 active stocks being traded on the New York Stock Exchange and if we are to analyze all stocks, it will take 676 seconds or 11.3 minutes per analysis year to complete the execution. Therefore, it will be beneficial to refactor the existing VBA code to make it more efficient.
